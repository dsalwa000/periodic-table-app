# PeriodicTableApp

This project was generated using [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 20.0.4.
It shows a periodic table and allows you to change its values and search for specific phrases.

# Important!!!
A library @ngrx/signals has to be downloaded via: npm i @ngrx/signals --legacy-peer-deps because there is no version 20. for it.
